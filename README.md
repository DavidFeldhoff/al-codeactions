# AL CodeActions

This extension provides code actions to the diagnostics reported by the AL Language extension.

## Features

Currently there are code actions for the diagnostics AL0118 and AL0132 which are shown when there is no definition for a word in a specific file.  
Of course the code action only shows up if the object with the missing definition is inside the current workspace, so that you are able to edit the file and create the procedure.  

See here how it works:

## About me

I started developing Dynamics NAV in 2014, but I always had an eye on other languages like Java or C# and was inspired by their development environment.  
Currently I work as a product developer at GWS mbH in Germany on the newest BC versions and thanks to the extensibility of VS Code it was quite obvious to me to help to improve the development environment of AL and give something small back to the awesome BC-Community. Feel free to contribute to the extension development or join us at [GWS mbH](https://www.gws.ms/en) to create some amazing BC-Apps.
